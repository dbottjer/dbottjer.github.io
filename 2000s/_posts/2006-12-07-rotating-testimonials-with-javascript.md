title: rotating testimonials with javascript
---

Very simple text rotator. No blending, just rotation. the quotes array could be dynamically grabbed from somewhere, or you could simply have the rotate function grab it randomly from somewhere instead of from the array. since these are just testimonials that i'm rotating over, i don't think anyone will have the page up for like 100 hours, and if they do, they can just see the same ones cached in js memory.

you could also simply build the array included here dynamically when you are writing out your page. this is really just here for the logical example.

of course, modify the html to fit your needs.
