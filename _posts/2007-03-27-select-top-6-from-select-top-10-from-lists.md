- Steve Yegge: [10 Great Books](http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/ten-great-books)

my personal top 10 items, in no particular order, out of the top 50 of these (i won't include the books) are:
- learn from mistakes. they will happen anyway.
- consult before you rewrite.
- communication is the hardest part.
- rely on proven technology.
- process is no substitute for thinking.
- Get out of your office.
- keep it simple.
- add value all the time.
- learn to say no.
- all things are not equal.
- show respect to everyone.

the OCD among you will see that there are 11. i couldn't let the 11th one there drop off, showing respect for your juniors and seniors i believe is a critical aspect to success. this applies to all area of life.

enjoy!
