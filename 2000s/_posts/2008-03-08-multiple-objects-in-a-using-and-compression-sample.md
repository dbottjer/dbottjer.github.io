title: multiple objects in a using and compression sample
---

Found something nifty I didn't know about today. create multiple objects in a single using statement. I figured i would include some sample code i use for compression/decompression. I'm using the #ziplib libraries, but you could use any stream based process really. The bufferSize variable you can change to fit your needs.
