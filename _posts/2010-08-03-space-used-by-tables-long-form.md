title: Space used by tables, long form
---

After my recent post, I had a couple of conversations and an email exchange with a colleague of mine and I was reminded of the fact that I went originally out to search for my 'original' table space used script. I couldn't find it online (even though I found it on my hdd) and that prompted me to put together the newer method. Which is considerably shorter. But here is my original script which essentially I wrote by looking at what was in sp_spaceused and just formatting it more to my liking.
