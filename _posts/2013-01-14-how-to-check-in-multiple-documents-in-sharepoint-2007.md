title: How to check in multiple documents in Sharepoint 2007
---

So the other day I did an extract from another documentation system of a few thousand diagrams. I copied these all up to sharepoint but the library I was storing them on had versioning. So how to check them in?

Very simple! (assuming you have permissions, which I did)

- Click Site Actions > View Reports > Checked Out To Me
- Select the documents you want
- Actions > Check In

(edit: I had pictures here, but our image uploader is on the fritz, so now itâ€™s just a list!)
