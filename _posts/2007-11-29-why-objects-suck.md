title: Why Objects Suck

I saw this great article over at codeproject: http://www.codeproject.com/gen/design/theWrongObject.asp.

Here is one part I found to be particularly on point:

> Now, the diagram above is a bit silly, but I think it's also illustrative of the evolution in both hardware and software architectures. The last column, "Aspect Computing", is something I have totally invented, but it seems to me that as distributed services develop and components/component communication is standardized, a significant amount of "programming" will simply be gluing together disparate components, handling events, and coordinating the flow of data between them.

I totally agree with this and I would say we are almost there. With mashups becoming ever more popular and the new progress made with OBA and the ability to have users write simple workflow driven applications, I would say "Aspect Computing" is already here. Heck, look at all the incredible social apps for friendster, myspace, and all of the other social networks. How about the new google mobile that will give you gps like ability. All those are examples of  "gluing together disparate components, handling events, and coordinating the flow of data between them."
