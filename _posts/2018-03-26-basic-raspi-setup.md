title: Basic RasPi Setup

I've done this so many times and I feel like I look up the instructions and do the same thing almost every time. I'm going to document it here so I don't forget. =) Basically, I am just following the official instructions, with some post-setup.

1. Download an image from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
1. While that is downloading, [get etcher](https://etcher.io/) if you don't have it.
1. Create empty file on root drive named ssh. On my mac, `touch /Volumes/boot/ssh`
