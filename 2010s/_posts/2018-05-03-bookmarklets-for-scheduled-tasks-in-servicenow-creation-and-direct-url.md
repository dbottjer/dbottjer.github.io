subtitle: Little helpers for ServiceNow ScheduledTasks
---
So, recently we've moved over to ServiceNow for incident/request management. There are two things I wanted to be able to do:

- Create a ticket and autopopulate it with a few things. (In my case, I am really just creating an item to track some work for myself, so I usually just use the same info, record some notes, and later close it so we have a 'number' to use for auditing)
- Get a link to a scheduled task to send to other folks or add to my notes if I want to link to it.

To that end, I created a couple of bookmarklets.

These are not perfect, but they are just little helpers for me. Maybe they'll work for you!
