title: Blog Migration/Update
date: '2022-06-06'

I've decided to migrate all of my blog back to royashbrook.com. Why... well, that just seems more like home for my stuff. =)

For years I had me@royashbrook.com setup as my email, but i decided to move it to roy@ashbrook.io some time back. This prompted me to want to move my blog over to be consistent.

I opened up a o365 tenant and setup a new github repo for this. It's still available
