title: ping check - aka isup
---

this is a very simple shell script that i used to use for ping checks. i found that it even outperformed using the wmi ping and several other mechanisms for pinging machines that i tried. i'm sure i could rant on at length about all of the times and ways that i had used it, but i won't. note that you could just look for 1 as an error and just use error level, i wanted to return 1 for up and 0 for down though so i had to put some logic to handle that.

this is a very simple ping check for vbscript. it's basically the same thing as above, just in vbscript, not shell.
