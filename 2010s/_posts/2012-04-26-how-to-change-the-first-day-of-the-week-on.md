title: How to change the first day of the week on Windows 7
---

Recently I was working to populate a Date Dimension table and I discovered that the script used was basing the first of the week on my local machine. This was fine except I wanted to line up my weeks against our financial system which hand the end of the week on Friday, not Saturday is it looks like on a normal calendar.

Basically making the effective change below:

To do this, I performed these steps:

1. Open control panel
2. Go to Clock/Language/Region
3. Under Date and Time, click Set the date and time
4. Click Change date and time button
5. Click Change calendar settings link
6. Change First day of the week to your desired day
7. Click OK, OK, OK, OK to get out of the dialogue boxes
8. You are done!

Images of the steps are below (excluding the first step of opening control panel):
