title: Fit Window for All Pages Visio macro (FWAP!)
---

I have been editing a *lot* of Visio diagrams recently. One of the issues I have with a lengthy session of Visio editing is the documents all get kind of wonky sometime because I have zoomed a ton or something. This isnâ€™t a big deal but if I want to screen share and blow through the slides really quick to review itâ€™s a pain. Hereâ€™s a macro to fit each visio window to page. I call it FWAP (Fit Window for All Pages) ðŸ˜€.

So far my only sadness is that Visio 2010 doesnâ€™t appear to have an option to just add the macro to the quick bar. Ah well, hotkeys to the rescue I suppose.
