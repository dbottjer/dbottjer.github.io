title: deploying ssis to file system or server
---

i personally like the file system. it's generally easier on me since i'm normally authoring the jobs and don't have hundreds of packages to manage. if i did have hundreds of packages to manage and i didn't author, i might prefer the server. here are some great blog posts about this subject.

[pros and cons of both](http://www.sqljunkies.com/WebLog/knight_reign/archive/2005/05/05/13523.aspx)

As a bonus during my research I came across this blog which appears to detail an experience of trying to continuously integrate a data-mart among other things.
