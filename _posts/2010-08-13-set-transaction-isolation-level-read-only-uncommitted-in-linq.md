title: set transaction isolation level read only uncommitted in LINQ
---

apparently you can use a transaction scope for this and just wrap everything that way. but to me that seems more complicated than just enabling it with execute command.

some LINQ code like (note that â€˜thisâ€™ is a data context):

```csharp
this.ExecuteCommand("set transaction isolation level read uncommitted"); 
MyTable.Take(5).Dump();
```

Produces this sql code:

```sql
set transaction isolation level read uncommitted 
GO

SELECT TOP 5 <fieldnamesâ€¦> FROM [MyTable] AS [t0] 
GO
```

Thatâ€™s what I want to see, so yay. ðŸ˜€

ps. trying to use livewriter today. so far, not excited about it and still like word more ðŸ˜› hopefully iâ€™ll get elightened.
