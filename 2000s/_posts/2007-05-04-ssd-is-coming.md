Solid state baby! It's coming!

This isn't really anything new, but I'm just chomping at the bit for solid state to really take off. 

The i-RAM from Gigabyte can be seen [here](http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Storage/Products_Overview.aspx?ProductID=2180)) and is exactly what I dreamed of back in the late 90s. I'm still surprised that more of these items haven't come out with the relative cheapness of RAM.
