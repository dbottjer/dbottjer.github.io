title: how can i find when a stored procedure was last executed in sql 2005?
---

check out below. obviously replace procname with the procname you want to find. you might get multiple results, and you can probably clean it up some, but it works fine for what i generally need to get the info for. while i was researching this, i also came accross the second pretty cool query below.

The second query came from [here](http://glennberrysqlperformance.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!45041418ECCAA960!248.entry)
