title: Gibson Robot Guitar
---

Those of you that know me personally are aware I'm an amateur guitar player. I started playing a little over a year ago and it's been a great experience. A couple months ago, [Gibson](gibson.com) released the [Robot Guitar](gibson.com/robotguitar)!

Here's a little blurb from the Gibson site:

> Since the dawn of the instrument, musicians have come to accept the guitar's imperfections and lack of tonal precision as necessary evils. Onstage and off, guitarists have fought to stay in tune. Every music lover and performer has had to suffer through the show—halting, mood-killing atonal droning of a loudly amped guitar being brought into tune. And in the studio, or at home, imprecise intonation throws the guitar in and out of tune, up and down the neck, as the instrument requires tweaking with each season and at times with each string change. 
> 
> For as long as the guitar has existed, guitar lovers have had two choices—live with a temperamental and out-of-tune instrument or make frequent trips to the shop for setups. Not anymore. 
> 
> Introducing the Gibson Robot Guitar. All you have to do is play it.

This guitar has been awesome. Sadly, the pull out button that you use to do all the fun stuff came off the other day. I took it to the shop and the guitar repair guy had sadly (for me) gone to a Van Halen concert, which was good for him. =P Further bad luck for me is that it is a holiday weekend and the repair shop is closed until Tuesday. They assured me they would take care of it for me on Tuesday first thing so I will be back up there then and I'll let everyone know how my first interaction with Gibson's customer service and Guitar Center's repair shop goes. =) I expect great things based on my trips to their shop.
