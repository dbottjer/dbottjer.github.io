I've decided to migrate all of my blog back to royashbrook.com. Why... well, that just seems more like home for my stuff and i think it's time to move back.

I had hosted my blog at various places over the years, but in 2018 i decided to register ashbrook.io and move my blog there. I grabbed an o365 tenant for email and other fun stuff and setup a jekyll site on github pages. that has worked great since june of 2018. recently, i decided i wanted to move back to royashbrook.com. i figured i'd rather have my name in the domain anyway and i have owned that domain for i dunno how long. ashbrook.io seemed cool at the time and i'll probably keep it for family use email and things like that.

i was also kind of tired of my blog theme. i have been using https://beautifuljekyll.com/ since moving to github pages. I like it, but it was a little heavier than my actual personal style (more plugins than i really wanted/needed) and a little prettier than my personal style. =) To that end, i have switched over to a theme based on https://andrewhwanpark.github.io/brutalist-blog/. i came across this theme when i was just looking for inspiration. as with many folks using github pages (i'm sure) i started out looking through things to maybe be 'inspired' and then you basically end up using a theme so you can go back to blogging =P when searching for a link to this blog later on google, i found that brutalist websites are actually a thing. definitely more my style personally. i don't want a brutalist house, but i'm pretty minimal/functional on my design choices for applications. my second choice was https://p0wex.github.io/Gesko/ for a theme, so actually kind of close haha.
